# Comments To Evaluators

It was decided to use TryGetValue when looking for an instance of a value, due to the possibility of it not existing, 
rather than creating a new default value to represent the value whenever it is not found to exist

# Consulted Peers

I did not consult peers due to it not being necessary, at least while I was formulating a solution to the problem
as I was able to find a effective solution relatively quickly.
