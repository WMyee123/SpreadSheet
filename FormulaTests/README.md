# Comments To Evaluators

I acknowledge that there are no explicit tests within this that test the GetVariables() function, however in 
performing the standard construction of the formula and checking for validity, every path within this function 
is tested thoroughly


# Consulted Peers

I did not consult peers due to it not being necessary, at least while I was formulating a solution to the problem
as I was able to find a effective solution relatively quickly.
